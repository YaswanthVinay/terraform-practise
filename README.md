### Managing Infrastructure with Terraform

### Terraform TAINT-COMMAND

#### Overview

This repository demonstrates how to manage infrastructure using Terraform, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. Terraform allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources in a declarative manner, enabling easier management, versioning, and collaboration.

#### Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download Terraform from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Terraform is installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd terraform-demo
```

#### Configuration

In this repository, you'll find a `main.tf` file which contains the Terraform configuration for provisioning instances on your cloud provider of choice. Before you proceed, make sure to update the necessary variables in `main.tf` such as `region`, `instance_type`, etc., according to your requirements.

#### Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:

```bash
terraform init
```

2. Review the execution plan to ensure Terraform will create the desired infrastructure:

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply the Terraform configuration to create the instances:

```bash
terraform apply
```

4. Once the instances are running, manually try to stop one of the instances using your cloud provider's console or CLI.

5. Tag the stopped instance as tainted using Terraform:

```bash
terraform taint <resource_name>
```

6. Apply the Terraform configuration again:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will destroy the tainted resource and recreate it, ensuring that your infrastructure remains consistent with your configuration.

#### Cleanup

To clean up the resources created by Terraform, simply run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
