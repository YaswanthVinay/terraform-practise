![Terraform Logo](https://www.terraform.io/assets/images/og-image-8b3e4f7d.png)

## Description

Learn how to manage Terraform state securely with AWS services. This tutorial guides you through setting up DynamoDB for state locking and S3 for state storage, ensuring consistency and preventing conflicts in your infrastructure deployments. Follow along as we configure Terraform to use DynamoDB and S3 as backends, adhering to AWS Free Tier limits for cost-effective solutions. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of best practices for managing Terraform state in collaborative environments.
